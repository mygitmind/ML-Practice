This folder contains all the exercise assignments given in Machine Learning Stanford Online Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
I have included all the exercise files to make it easy to run on your system. 
However, my contribution is limited to the exercise files or to complete the specific functionality asked to complete 
in the assignment.

Before seeking any guidance from this solved assignment, I would highly recommend to discuss in the discussion forum.
This course has amazing moderator support to help navigating your thoughts to the write direction to complete these assignments.

Tutorials and Test cases were very valued to complete the code assignments and test them out which was a very important.

Enjoy Machine Learning!
